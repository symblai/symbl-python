# Symbl Python SDK

The Symbl Python SDK provides convenient access to the Symbl API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for a simple and clear utilization of APIs.


## Documentation

See the [Python API docs](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/).


## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade symbl
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

### Requirements

-   Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+ (PyPy supported)

### Usages

The library needs to be configured with your account's credentials (appId & appSecret) which is
available in your [Symbl Dashboard][api-keys].


## A speech to text converter under 5 lines of code

```python
import symbl

# Initialize with credentials
symbl.init(app_id=<app_id>, app_secret=<app_secret>)

# Process audio file
conversation_id = symbl.async_api.process_audio_file(file_path=<file_path>)

# Get Transcription as array of messages
transcription_messages = symbl.conversation_api.get_messages(conversation_id)

# Printing transcription messages
print(transcription_messages)
```

## Get topics and action items from your call

```python
import symbl

# Initialize with credentials
symbl.init(app_id=<app_id>, app_secret=<app_secret>)

# Process audio file
conversation_id = symbl.async_api.process_audio_file(file_path=<file_path>)

# Get topics as array
topics = symbl.conversation_api.get_topics(conversation_id)

# Get Action items
action_items = symbl.conversation_api.get_action_items(conversation_id)

# Printing transcription messages
print("Topics are = " + str(topics))

print("Action Items = " + str(action_items))
```

## SpeechToText of multiple audio files in a directory 

```python

import symbl
from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join


# Initialize with credentials
symbl.init(app_id=<app_id>, app_secret=<app_secret>)

# returns lambda function with fileName which is under processing
def save_transcriptions_in_file(fileName):
    return lambda jobPayload: on_success(jobPayload, fileName)

# returns actual callback to save the transcriptions of a conversation in a file
def on_success(jobPayload, fileName):
    transcriptions = symbl.conversations_api.get_messages(jobPayload['conversationId'])

    file = open(fileName + ".txt","w+")
    file.write(str(transcriptions))
    file.close()

# Look [here][unicodeerror], if you're getting unicode error
directory_path = r'<directory_path>'

files = [join(directory_path, file) for file in listdir(directory_path) if isfile(join(directory_path, file))]

# Process audio files in the above mentioned directory
for file in files:
    job = symbl.async_api.submit_audio(file_path=file, wait=False).on_complete(save_transcriptions_in_file(file))

```

## Analysis of your Zoom Call on your email (Symbl will join your zoom call and send you analysis on provided email)

```python

import symbl

symbl.init(app_id=<app_id>, app_secret=<app_secret>)

phoneNumber = "" # Zoom phone number to be called, check here https://us02web.zoom.us/zoomconference
meetingId = "" # Your zoom meetingId
password = "" # Your zoom meeting passcode
emailId = ""

connection = symbl.telephony_api.startEndpoint({
      "endpoint": {
        "type": "pstn",
        "phoneNumber": phoneNumber,
        "dtmf": ",,{}#,,{}#".format(meetingId, password)
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "invokeOn": "stop",
          "name": "sendSummaryEmail",
          "parameters": {
            "emails": [
              emailId
            ],
          },
        },
      ],
      "data": {
        "session": {
          "name": "Meeting name",
        },
      },
    })

print(connection)

```
