# Symbl Python SDK

The Symbl Python SDK provides convenient access to the Symbl API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for a simple and clear utilization of APIs.

## Documentation

See the [Python API docs](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade symbl
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Configuration

To initialize the SDK, you need to provide app_id and app_token which you can get by signing up on [Symbl Platform][api-keys].

You can either provide the api_keys by saving a file named symbl.conf in your home directory in the following format.

>Home directory will be C:/Users/\<Your Username\> on your windows system, or ~ in your Linux or Mac system.

```conf
[credentials]
app_id=<app_id>
app_secret=<app_secret>
```

### Requirements

- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+ (PyPy supported)

### Usages

The library needs to be configured with your account's credentials (appId & appSecret) which is
available in your [Symbl Platform][api-keys].

connection = symbl.Telephony.start_pstn(
      # credentials={app_id: <app_id>, app_secret: <app_secret>}, #Optional, Don't add this parameter if you have symbl.conf file in your home directory
      phone_number=phoneNumber,
      dtmf = ",,{}#,,{}#".format(meetingId, password),
      actions = [
        {
          "invokeOn": "stop",
