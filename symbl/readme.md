# Key Terms

**What is a ConversationId?**
>
>When you process any conversation through Symbl whether it's from Async API, Javascript SDK, Telephony or Streaming API, you'll always receive a unique Conversation ID (conversationId), which consists of numerical digits.
>

**What is a JobId?**

>As soon as you upload one of your files, or send one of your text for processing to Symbl, You get a jobId (and a conversationId) in response. This jobId is a unique identifier for the job processing the payload you sent.
>
>A job can have a particular status at a time wiz. IN_PROGRESS, SCHEDULED, COMPLETED or FAILED. You can only use a conversationId for the conversation_api class functions once, the job payload is completed.

# Audio class

Symbl's Async APIs provide the functionality for processing audio recordings from files or public/signed URLs. The data processed for these conversations are available via the Conversation APIs once the APIs have completed the processing.

# Telephony class

Based on PSTN and SIP protocols, the Telephony API provides an interface for the developers to have Symbl bridge/join VoIP calls and get the results back in real-time as well. Optionally, the developer can also trigger an email at the end of the conversation containing the URL to view the transcription, insights and topics in a single page Web Application.

You can subscribe the following events for Telephony API by the connection object

    > 1. **insight_response** :- generates an event whenever a question or an action_item is found.
    > 2. **message_response**:- generates an event whenever a transcription is available.
    > 3. **transcript_response**:- (Part of telephony API), these are also transcription values, however these will include an isFinal property which will be False initially           meaning the transcription are not finalized.

# Streaming class

Symbl's Streaming API is based on WebSocket protocol and can be used for real-time use-cases where both the audio and its results from Symbl's back-end need to be available in real-time.
